# Migrating from v1 to v2

## Introduction

This is a reference for upgrading your Pylon from v1 to v2. Version 2 introduces the support for various runtimes, a new npm create command, and an improved development server.
The official supported runtimes by the `npm create pylon` command are Bun, Node.js and Cloudflare Workers. Other runtimes are also supported but require manual setup.
If you’re curious what’s new, head over to the [v2.0 Release Notes](./v2.0.mdx).

For most users we expect a smooth upgrade path as only a couple of changes will be required:

## Updating your dependencies

You need to update your dependencies to the latest version of Pylon. The `@getcronit/pylon-cli` and `@getcronit/pylon-server` are no longer required and replaced by the `@getcronit/pylon-dev` package.

### Update Pylon version

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@getcronit/pylon": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Replace old dependencies with pylon-dev

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-    "@getcronit/pylon-cli": "^1.0.0",
-    "@getcronit/pylon-server": "^1.0.0"
+    "@getcronit/pylon-dev": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Updating scripts

Pylon v2 introduces a new `pylon dev` command that handles multiple runtimes.
You can choose your specific start command by using `-c <command>`.

### Update your start script

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "develop": "bun run pylon develop"
+    "dev": "pylon dev -c 'bun run .pylon/index.js'"
  }
}
```

### Update your build script

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "build": "bun run pylon build"
+    "build": "pylon build"
  }
}
```

## Handling breaking changes

Next, we’ll cover the breaking changes that you might encounter when upgrading to Pylon v2.
In order to successfully update, you’ll need to resolve these changes.

### GraphQL definition

We have updated the way you define your GraphQL schema. Instead of the default export of the `defineService` function you now have to export a `graphql` object.
This allows for supporting multiple runtimes that depend on the default export.

**Before**

```typescript
import { defineService } from "@getcronit/pylon";

export default defineService({
  graphql: {
    Query: {
      sum: (a: number, b: number) => a + b,
    },
    Mutation: {
      divide: (a: number, b: number) => a / b,
    },
  },
});
```

**After**

```typescript
import { app } from "@getcronit/pylon";

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    sum: (a: number, b: number) => a + b,
  },
  Mutation: {
    divide: (a: number, b: number) => a / b,
  },
};

export default app;
```

### Custom routes and middleware

The `app` instance is now used to define custom routes and middleware. This change allows for a more flexible API and better integration with the underlying runtimes.

**Before**

```typescript
import { PylonAPI } from "@getcronit/pylon";

export const configureApp: PylonAPI["configureApp"] = (app) => {
  app.get("/hello", (ctx, next) => {
    return new Response("Hello, world!");
  });
};
```

**After**

```typescript
import { app } from "@getcronit/pylon";

app.get("/hello", (ctx, next) => {
  return new Response("Hello, world!");
});
```

### Logging

The `logger` instance has been removed due to the lack of customizability. We are still looking into a better solution for logging in the future.
If you know of a good solution, [please let us know](https://github.com/getcronit/pylon/issues/new/choose).

Instead of using the `logger` instance, please use `console` for logging, or your favorite logging library.

```diff
- import { logger } from "@getcronit/pylon";

- logger.info("Hello, world!");
+ console.log("Hello, world!");
```

### Client Generation (GQty)

You only need to update the client generation if you are using the feature described in the [Client Generation](/docs/client-generation) guide.

```diff
{
-  "pylon": {
-    "gqty": "./frontend/src/gqty/index.ts"
-  },
   "scripts": {
-    "dev": "pylon dev -c 'bun run .pylon/index.js'",
+    "dev": "pylon dev -c 'bun run .pylon/index.js' --client --client-path ./frontend/src/gqty/index.ts --client-port 3000",
   }
}
```

### Dockerfile

If you are using a Dockerfile to build your Pylon project, you need to update the `ENTRYPOINT` to replace the `pylon-server` command.

```diff
- ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "./node_modules/.bin/pylon-server" ]
+ ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "/usr/src/pylon/.pylon/index.js" ]
```
