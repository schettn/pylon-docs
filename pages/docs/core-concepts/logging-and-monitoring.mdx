# Logging and Monitoring

Learn how Pylon enhances visibility into your application's performance and behavior with its integrated monitoring capabilities, ensuring smooth operations and rapid issue resolution.

## Overview

Pylon integrates robust error monitoring capabilities to help you maintain and monitor your web services effectively. In this section, we'll explore how to set up error monitoring with Sentry.

## Error Monitoring with Sentry

Pylon supports automatic integration with Sentry, a popular error tracking and monitoring service. To enable this integration, you need to set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. Once this is configured, all logs and errors are automatically sent to your Sentry project.

### Setting Up Sentry

1. **Get your Sentry DSN**: Sign up for a Sentry account and create a new project. Obtain the DSN (Data Source Name) for your project.

2. **Set the SENTRY_DSN Environment Variable**: Configure the `SENTRY_DSN` in your environment. This can typically be done in your project's environment configuration file or through your deployment pipeline.

```env
SENTRY_DSN=https://your_sentry_dsn@sentry.io/project-id
```

3. **Deploy your Pylon service**: With the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable set, deploy your Pylon service. Logs and errors will now be automatically sent to Sentry.

### Example

```typescript
import { app } from "@getcronit/pylon";

export const graphql = {
  Mutation: {
    divide: (a: number, b: number) => {
      if (b === 0) {
        console.error("Attempt to divide by zero");
        throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed");
      }
      console.info(`Dividing ${a} by ${b}`);
      return a / b;
    },
  },
};

export default app;
```

In this example, any errors or logs generated by the `sum` and `divide` operations will be captured and sent to Sentry if the `SENTRY_DSN` is configured.

## Conclusion

By integrating Sentry for error monitoring, Pylon provides a comprehensive solution to track and manage the health and performance of your web services. Ensure that your `SENTRY_DSN` is set up correctly to take full advantage of these powerful tools, enabling you to maintain a robust and reliable application.
